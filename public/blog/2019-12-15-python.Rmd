When it comes to Python, in comparison to R, to view the data, you must insert “.describe” instead of inserting “view” or “summary.” I also learned to insert “plt.scatter” to view a scatterplot of your data. Being able to visualize your numbers can tremendously aid scientists and data analysts in whatever source of information they are piecing together.  

```{r}
library(reticulate)
```

```{python}
import pandas as pd

faithful=pd.read_csv("https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/datasets/faithful.csv")

faithful["eruptions"].describe()

```
